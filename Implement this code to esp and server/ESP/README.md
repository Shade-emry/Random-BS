# Explanation & Deployment

## File Organization

- **main.cpp**  
  Replace your existing `main.cpp` in your ESP firmware project with the updated version provided here.
  
- **Supporting Files**  
  Ensure that the following files are present in your project:
  - `imu_axis_correction.h`
  - `imu_axis_correction.cpp`
  - The VQF library (available from [https://github.com/dlaidig/vqf](https://github.com/dlaidig/vqf))

## I²C Settings

- The I²C address for the BNO08x sensor is set to **0x4A**.
- Verify that your physical connections and I²C pins (`PIN_IMU_SDA`, `PIN_IMU_SCL`) are correctly defined in your `GlobalVars.h` (or similar configuration file).

## Compilation & Testing

1. **Compile the Project:**  
   Build the firmware project in your development environment.

2. **Deploy the Firmware:**  
   Upload the firmware to your ESP device.

3. **Monitoring:**  
   Once deployed, open the Serial Monitor.  
   - You will see the standard system logs generated by `sensorManager.update()`.  
   - Additionally, the debug output from the temperature-compensated orientation update will be printed as **"TempComp Orientation"**.

## Optional Reporting

- In the `updateTempCompensatedOrientation()` function, there is a commented-out section that can be enabled to transmit raw temperature values to your server.
- Uncomment and modify these lines if you wish to perform remote debugging or drift analysis.

This merged `main.cpp` has been checked for syntax consistency and is intended to compile in your SlimeVR ESP project. Please test it and let me know if any further adjustments are required.
